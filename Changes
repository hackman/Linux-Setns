1.00  Wed Aug 17 19:20:10 2016
	- Almost complete rewrite of the function!
	- Changed the interface, to setns(). Now instead of file descriptor we directly give it path to a namespace file. This removes the need to convert Perl FD into C FD.
	- Improved the error handling and now we catch all setns() errors
	- Replaced __NR_setns with SYS_setns. In order for the change to work I also changed the included headers
	- Simplified the setns() function in the XS code
	- Replaced the PPCODE with CODE and now I properly return the RETVAL from the XS code
	- Added new test for invalid path
