=head1 NAME

Linux::Setns - Perl extension for switching the current process namespace to another namespace pointed by a path to the ns file descriptor.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Linux::setns qw(setns CLONE_ALL CLONE_NEWIPC CLONE_NEWNET CLONE_NEWUTS CLONE_NEWUSER CLONE_NEWPID);

	die "setns() requires root privileges\n" if $>;

	setns("/proc/PID/ns/mnt", CLONE_ALL);
	# now your process is in the same namespaces(IPC,NET,UTS,PID,USER,MOUNT) as the /proc/PID/ns/mnt 

	# If you want to change only one of your namespaces you can use any of the bellow examples:

	# Switch your current Mount namespace to the one pointed by /proc/PID/ns/mnt
	setns("/proc/PID/ns/mnt", CLONE_NEWNS);

	# Switch your current IPC namespace to the one pointed by /proc/PID/ns/ipc
	setns("/proc/PID/ns/ipc", CLONE_NEWIPC);

	# Switch your current Network namespace to the one pointed by /proc/PID/ns/net
	setns("/proc/PID/ns/net", CLONE_NEWNET);

	# Switch your current UTS namespace to the one pointed by /proc/PID/ns/uts
	setns("/proc/PID/ns/uts", CLONE_NEWUTS);

	# Switch your current Pid namespace to the one pointed by /proc/PID/ns/pid
	setns("/proc/PID/ns/pid", CLONE_NEWPID);

	# Switch your current User namespace to the one pointed by /proc/PID/ns/user
	setns("/proc/PID/ns/user", CLONE_NEWUSER);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This trivial module provides interface to the Linux setns system call. It
also provides the CLONE_* constants that are used to specify which kind of
namespace you are entering. Also a new CLONE_ALL constat is provided so you
can join/switch to any type of namespace.

The setns system call allows a process to 'join/switch' one of its namespaces
to namespaces pointed by a file descriptor(usually located in /proc/PID/ns/{ipc,mnt,net,pid,user,uts}).

Note: keep in mind that using any specific CLONE_NEW* constant will fail if the FD path 
you gave is not of that type.

RETRUN VALUE
	1 on success
	0 on failure


=head2 EXPORT

 setns			- the subroutine

 CLONE_ALL		- flag that tells that the path can be of any namespace type
 CLONE_NEWNS	- when this flag is used the path must be from another Mount namespace
 CLONE_NEWIPC	- when this flag is used the path must be from another IPC namespace
 CLONE_NEWNET	- when this flag is used the path must be from another Network namespace
 CLONE_NEWUTS	- when this flag is used the path must be from another UTS namespace
 CLONE_NEWPID	- when this flag is used the path must be from another PID namespace
 CLONE_NEWUSER	- when this flag is used the path must be from another User namespace
